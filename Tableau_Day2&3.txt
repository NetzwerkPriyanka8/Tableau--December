Opens a new worksheet. This is a blank slate where you can create your first view.
Displays the data source you are connected to. If you are using multiple data sources, you can see them all listed here.
Adds columns from your data source to the Data pane on the left side. Columns are added as fields.
Automatically assigns data types (such as date, number, string, etc.) and roles (dimension or measure) to your data.
